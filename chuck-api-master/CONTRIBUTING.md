# How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

If you have a feature or bugfix you would like to add please fork the repository and create a branch off of the development branch. Prefix your branch with either "FEATURE_", "BUGFIX_", or something similar describing the type of update, and then add a descriptive name such as "BUGFIX_random_files_erased". Please try to avoid monolithic commits.

Once your update is complete, rebase development and resolve conflicts locally. Once all the conflicts are resolved, submit a pull request for the development branch and I will review the update and add any change requests or comments. After all requests are complete I will merge your pull request into the development branch.
